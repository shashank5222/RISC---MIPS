Hey! Everyone,
This project is about working of MIPS32 microproccessor which is one of the example of RISC-V. Here in this project I performed few machine operation depending upon a user need that,
what machine code he/she wants to perform. for example I performed the machine code operation such as-:
ADD,ADDI,LOAD,STORE,HLT,SUBI and etc. here also if you go through with my testbench you found that i have add summy dummy instruction for increasing the delay between two machine code
